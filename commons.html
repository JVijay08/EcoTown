        <h1>Tragedy of the Commons</h1>
        <p>Here are some examples of ways that we're currently endangering our limited resources. Learn and explore ways we can stop this from progressing!</p>

            <div class="cardinfo">
                <h2>Groundwater Depletion</h2>
                <p>We're pumping too much water out of the ground, which is leading to the draining of the limited aquifers we have underground. To limit the draining, make your daily water use more efficient!</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="commonscard">
            <div class="cardbg" style="background-image: url('commons2.jpg');"></div>
            <div class="cardinfo">
                <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
                <p>We're polluting our local rivers and lakes with trash, chemicals, sewage, etc. This is degrading the water itself and the ecosystem in that water. To stop this, we must control how we recycle things, limit fertilizer use, etc. </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="commonscard">
            <div class="cardbg" style="background-image: url('commons3.jpg');"></div>
            <div class="cardinfo">
                <h2>Overuse of Farmland Soil</h2>
                <p>We're farming too much and too quickly, and the ground can't quickly replenish its nutrients. Because of this, the soil is being heavily degraded. To stop this, we must do things like crop rotation, use more natural fertilizers, etc.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="commonscard">
            <div class="cardbg" style="background-image: url('commons4.jpg');"></div>
            <div class="cardinfo">
                <h2>Deforestation of Local Woodlands</h2>
                <p>Too many trees are being cleared for development purposes. To stop the deforestation, we must replant trees, get laws to limit deforestation passed, etc.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="commonscard">
            <div class="cardbg" style="background-image: url('commons5.jpg');"></div>
            <div class="cardinfo">
                <h2>Air Pollution</h2>
                <p>We're releasing too much carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the air due to our vehicle emissions, factories, etc. To stop this, we have to more efficiently use our vehicles (like with carpool), transition to a more renewable energy source, and promote alternative forms of energy use to limit CO_2!</p>
            </div>
        </div>

            <div class="cardinfo">
                <h2>Public Park Neglect</h2>
                <p>Our public parks are being neglected and sometimes underused. People litter without any care and not many people make the effort to clean up the mess left behind. To stop this, more people need to volunteer for park cleanups, more people need to be taught how to throw away trash correctly, and people need to be informed about what their actions are doing. </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="commonscard">
            <div class="cardbg" style="background-image: url('commons7.jpg');"></div>
            <div class="cardinfo">
                <h2>Wildlife Habitat Loss</h2>
                <p>Because of our urban cities increasing in size, we're enroaching into more and more land that many animals call home, displacing them in the process. To stop this habitat loss, we need to make more conservation areas, reduce the amount of development we're doing, and even if we do a lot of development, we need more green methods of development.</p>

        <div class="commonscard">
            <div class="cardbg" style="background-image: url('commons8.jpg');"></div>
            <div class="cardinfo">
                <h2>Light Pollution</h2>
                <p>We're producing too much artificial lights from our cities and towns. This is blocking out our view of the stars and other cosmic objects during the night. To stop this, we need to use shielded lighting, turn off any lights that aren't needed, make policies to limit the light pollution, etc. </p>

            <div class="cardinfo">
                <h2>Waste Overload</h2>
                <p>Landfills are growing larger and larger yearly. This increases the amount of contaminated land and we lose more land we could've used for better purposes. To stop this, we have to reduce our use of single use plastics, reuse and recycle, compost, etc.</p>
